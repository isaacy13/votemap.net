# Contributing to votemap

Thank you for your interest in contributing to votemap! We welcome contributions of all sizes, from reporting typos to implementing new features.

## Getting started

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main` named using the pattern `feat/short-description` or `fix/short-description`.
2. Run the project locally (see `README.md`) and make your changes.
3. Add tests and documentation when reasonably possible.
4. Open a pull request against `main` with a clear description and link to any related issue.

## Branching & PR guidelines

- Keep PRs focused and small.
- Include a short, descriptive PR title and a detailed description in the PR body.
- Reference any related issues (e.g., "Closes #123").
- Add tests where relevant and ensure TypeScript & lint pass (`npm run lint`).

## Commit messages

Use clear, present-tense commit messages. Example prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`.

## Review process

- PRs will be reviewed by maintainers or community reviewers.
- Address requested changes in follow-up commits and re-request review.

## Good first contributions

Look for issues labeled `good first issue`. If none exist, open an issue suggesting a small starter task.

## Reporting bugs and feature requests

- Use the issue templates (Bug report / Feature request) in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.

## Tests & CI

- This repository runs CI checks (lint & build) on PRs. Please ensure your branch is green before merging.
