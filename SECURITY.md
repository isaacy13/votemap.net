# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep votemap secure. Please follow these guidelines if you discover a security vulnerability.

## Reporting a vulnerability
- **Do not** create a public issue for security vulnerabilities (public issues are visible to everyone).
- Prefer private disclosure by either:
  - **Emailing** `support@votemap.net` (include an overview, affected versions, steps to reproduce, and any PoC).
  - **Using GitHub Security Advisories**: go to the repository **Security** tab → **Advisories** → **Report a vulnerability** — advisories are private by default and let us coordinate fixes before public disclosure.
- Provide: a clear description, affected versions, steps to reproduce, and a suggested remediation if known.

## Response & timeline
- We aim to acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and to work with you on a fix as quickly as possible.

## After a fix
- Once a fix is available, we will publish guidance on upgrading and coordinate a disclosure timeline.

Thank you for responsibly disclosing security issues and helping keep votemap safe.
